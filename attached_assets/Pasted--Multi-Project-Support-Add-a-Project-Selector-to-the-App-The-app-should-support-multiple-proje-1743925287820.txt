üîß Multi-Project Support: Add a Project Selector to the App

The app should support multiple projects, where the selected project is accessible across all project-aware pages. We want to show a Project Selector in the topbar (next to the title or before the right-side icons), and make the selected project available to any component using a global context.

‚úÖ Context Setup:

1. Create a new context file at `client/src/context/ProjectContext.tsx` that:
   - Exports a ProjectProvider to wrap the app
   - Uses React Context to store `selectedProject` and a `setSelectedProject` method
   - Accepts a `Project` with at least `id` and `name`

2. Update `main.tsx` to wrap the app in `<ProjectProvider>`

‚úÖ Project Selector Component:

3. Create a new file at `client/src/components/layout/ProjectSelector.tsx`
   - Renders a <select> or dropdown with mock project options
   - On selection, calls `setSelectedProject(...)`
   - Styled to fit into the topbar (compact, dark background, white text)

‚úÖ Topbar Integration:

4. Import and use `<ProjectSelector />` inside the Topbar component (Topbar.tsx)
   - Position it to the left of the icons but right of the title
   - Make sure it's aligned vertically with other topbar items
   - Do not expand it too wide ‚Äî use a max width and truncate long project names

‚úÖ Page Usage:

5. On pages like Dashboard, Assessments, AI Insights, Test Management:
   - Use the `useProject()` hook to access the current selected project
   - If `selectedProject` is `null`, show a friendly prompt like: ‚ÄúPlease select a project to continue.‚Äù

‚úÖ Static Page Exception:

6. Do NOT require a selected project on the Documentation page.
   - It should work without `useProject()`

üé® Style Guidelines:

- Use existing Tailwind classes like `bg-atmf-card`, `text-atmf-primary`, etc.
- Match the dark/glassy style of the topbar
- Match spacing and typography in dropdown text

üèÅ Goal:

Once complete, the app will support switching between multiple projects, and all project-related views (metrics, assessments, AI insights) will respect the selected context.
