### Lessons Learned

1. **Framework Complementarity**: Much of TMMi could be retained and enhanced rather than replaced by mapping to ATMF dimensions, reducing transition disruption.

2. **Documentation Evolution**: Shifting from document-centric to automation-supported documentation significantly reduced overhead while maintaining compliance.

3. **Incremental Migration**: A gradual, prioritized transition proved more successful than a complete framework replacement approach.

4. **Dual-Framework Expertise**: Developing expertise in both frameworks created valuable translation capabilities that facilitated the transition.

5. **Value Demonstration**: Early showcases of specific ATMF benefits within the existing framework built credibility and reduced resistance to change.

### Critical Reflections

The framework migration revealed important insights:

1. The initial approach was too focused on ATMF adoption rather than value delivery, creating unnecessary resistance that was later addressed through outcome-focused messaging.

2. More explicit mapping between frameworks earlier would have reduced confusion and accelerated acceptance.

3. The transition plan underestimated the effort required to modernize test assets while maintaining operations, requiring timeline adjustments.

4. Some ATMF practices required significant adaptation for the insurance context, highlighting the importance of industry-specific implementation guidance.
