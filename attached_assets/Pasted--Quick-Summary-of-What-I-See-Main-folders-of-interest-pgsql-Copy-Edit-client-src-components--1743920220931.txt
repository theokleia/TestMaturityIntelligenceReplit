Styling:

You have a single index.css at client/src/index.css

Tailwind is configured via tailwind.config.ts

Vite is in use → good for modern builds

🧩 1. Design System Evaluation
✅ Good signs:
You have a clean separation of reusable components under design-system/

page-container.tsx, atmf-card.tsx, status-badge.tsx, tab-view.tsx → this is great!

You’re using Tailwind with proper PostCSS setup

You already implemented consistent naming (e.g., metrics-card.tsx, ai-recommendation.tsx)

❗ Improvements to make it truly centralized and scalable:
Problem	Solution
metrics-card, maturity-card, etc. are under dashboard/	➤ If they are reused in other pages, consider moving them to design-system/ or components/common/
Styling logic likely exists in individual component files	➤ Move shared styling logic (borders, paddings, colors) into Tailwind classes or a utility module
No visible theme file or variables in design-system folder	➤ Create a theme.ts or tokens.ts file to centralize sizes, font weights, spacing, etc. as JS constants if you need JS-based styling (optional but helpful)
You don’t seem to have a global Layout component	➤ Create a /components/layout/layout.tsx that wraps all pages with sidebar + top nav consistently
Let me know if you'd like a code template for that layout.

🔁 2. Duplicate Dashboard Pages?
You Asked:
"I can also see that there are two places where the dashboard page is defined. I'm not sure which one is used currently."

✅ You’re not wrong — here's the breakdown:

Likely suspects:
pages/dashboard.tsx

This is most likely the actual route/page definition (i.e., /dashboard)

Usually contains <PageContainer> and uses cards/components from /components/dashboard/

components/dashboard/*.tsx

These are not full pages — they're pieces of the dashboard UI

E.g., metrics-card.tsx, ai-recommendation.tsx are components used by dashboard.tsx

✅ Safe Conclusion:
pages/dashboard.tsx is the only file you should consider “the page”

The others are children/partials

Do not delete any components/dashboard/*.tsx files unless you're sure they’re unused (I can help you confirm that too)

🛠 3. What to Give Replit (or AI tools) to Keep Pages Consistent
✅ Add a layout.tsx file:
Create this at client/src/components/layout/layout.tsx:

tsx
Copy
Edit
export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen bg-atmf-main text-atmf-primary">
      {/* Sidebar */}
      <aside className="w-64 bg-atmf-dark p-4">
        <div className="text-xl font-bold mb-6">ATMosFera</div>
        {/* Add navigation links here */}
      </aside>

      {/* Main content */}
      <main className="flex-1 p-6 overflow-y-auto">
        {children}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
Then in every page, wrap with this layout:

tsx
Copy
Edit
import Layout from "@/components/layout/layout";

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      {/* dashboard content here */}
    </Layout>
  );
}

✅ TL;DR Action List
Task	Done?
✅ Keep pages/dashboard.tsx and use it as the page	✅
❌ Avoid hardcoded layout in each page — add shared layout component	🚧
✅ Use Tailwind utilities and your design-system classes consistently	✅
❌ Move non-dashboard-specific reusable UI (cards, badges, etc.) into design-system/	🚧
✅ Create style-guide.tsx page to preview components (optional, dev-only)	👌
